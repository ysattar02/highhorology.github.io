                <h3> What is Horology? </h3>
                
                <p>
                    Horology is officially defined as the study of time.
                    It can also be defined as the art of designing and
                    making instruments 
                    that indicate time such as watches. The term "high horology"
                    typically refers to high-level watchmaking, 
                    including factors such as engineering, precision and accuracy. 
                    It is important to clarify that this does mean the same thing as 
                    luxury timepieces.

                <h3> Units of Time: </h3>
                
                <p>
                    As we all know, time is divided into seconds, minutes and hours.
                    However, I would always wonder how the numbers were decided for 
                    these units. Upon conducting some research, I came to this understanding.
                    Values for these units were based on splitting the amount of time it took 
                    the Earth to rotate fully on a vertical axis once. The hours were decided to
                    be 24 based on the ancient Egyptians dividing nightime into 12 sections based 
                    on the different visible orientations of stars. Thus we came to use 24 hours. 
                    Hours were determined to hold 60 minutes based on the ancient Babylonians sexagesimal
                    system which made 60 a prime candidate, due to the number of factors from the first few
                    numbers it has. Greek astronomers then further expanded on this by establishing there to
                    be 360 degrees in a sphere and deciding each degree was equal to 60 minutes.
